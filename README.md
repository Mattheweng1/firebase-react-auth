# Firebase-React-Auth Global Chatroom

This project was created to practice using Firebase Hosting and Authentication as well as React. If you're interested in checking it out, you'll have to sign up, but don't bother using a real email (it just needs to look like one). It's a throw-away account, so the password doesn't really matter either, but it still needs to be at least 6 characters. Once inside, feel free to check out the global chatroom!

## Features

- Firebase Authentication saves your created account so you can sign back in again any time.
- Update profile from the Dashboard.
- Join a global chatroom! You can see everyone's messages and they can see yours.

## Languages and Tools

- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- npm
- Webpack

## Note

I was just practicing React and Firebase, so the project is left in a very incomplete state.
